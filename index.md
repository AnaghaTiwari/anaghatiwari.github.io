# nice to meet you! 👋

i'm a 1st year phd student in cs at the university of chicago working at the  
[noise lab](https://noise-lab.net) under  
[dr. nick feamster](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~feamster/).

i'm a researcher working at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and financial networks. specifically, i'm focused on the development of neuro-symbolic AI methodologies to integrate logical reasoning with statistical and computational models to improve causal inference and representation. i aim to apply these techniques to study tail risk events and sector-specific, complex dynamics within financial markets.

## about me

domain areas:

- **ml / ai applications** – neuro-symbolic ai techniques that combine logic, probability, and neural networks to model and analyze financial data  
- **networks** – exploring how markets can be modeled via multi-dimensional, multi-spatial, temporal networks  
- **financial markets & uncertainty** – studying spillover effects in markets driven by uncertainty and tail risk  

### previous experiences

* risk & quant analyst @ **blackrock** (feb–sept 2025)  
* global banking & markets intern @ **bank of america** (summer 2024)  
* researcher @ **house & senate AI caucus NAIRR pilot** (may 2024)  
* visiting student & intern @ **argonne national laboratory** (summer 2023–may 2024)  
* b.s. in computer science & statistics @ **uiuc** (aug 2022–dec 2024)
